    * Predictive analytics for patient risk stratification.
    * Secure patient portal with customizable access controls (appointment scheduling, messaging, record access, prescription management).
    * Automated workflow management (appointment reminders, prescription refills, lab result notifications).
    * Integrated HIPAA-compliant telemedicine with secure video conferencing.
    * Role-based access control (RBAC) for physicians, nurses, administrative staff, and patients.
    * Comprehensive reporting and analytics dashboards.
    * Secure data exchange with external systems via APIs.

* **User Workflows:**
    * **Physician:** Access patient charts, order tests, view AI-driven diagnostic suggestions, communicate with patients, schedule appointments, generate reports.
    * **Nurse:** Manage appointments, input patient data, track lab results, communicate with physicians and patients.
    * **Administrative Staff:** Manage user accounts, handle billing, generate reports, manage system settings.
    * **Patient:** Access medical records, schedule appointments, communicate with providers, manage prescriptions, update personal information.

* **Data Management Requirements:**
    * Secure storage and management of sensitive patient data (HIPAA, GDPR compliant).
    * Data encryption at rest and in transit.
    * Robust data backup and disaster recovery plan.
    * Audit trails for all data access and modifications.
    * Data governance and compliance procedures.

* **Integration Requirements:**
    * Seamless integration with major EHR systems (e.g., Epic, Cerner) via APIs.
    * Integration with lab information systems (LIS) and radiology information systems (RIS).
    * Integration with pharmacy systems for prescription management.


**4. Non-Functional Requirements:**

* **Performance:**  The application should respond to requests within 2 seconds under normal load.  Scalability testing should be conducted to ensure performance under peak load conditions.

* **Reliability:**  The system should have high availability (99.9%) with minimal downtime.

**5. Technical Requirements:**

* **Technology Stack:**
    * Backend: FastAPI (Python) with a microservices architecture.
    * Frontend: React.js
    * Database: PostgreSQL (or similar robust relational database)
    * Cloud Infrastructure: AWS (or Azure)
    * AI/ML Framework: TensorFlow/PyTorch (or similar)

* **API Specifications:**  RESTful APIs will be used for communication between the frontend and backend, and for integration with third-party systems.  Detailed API specifications will be documented using OpenAPI.

* **Database Schema Considerations:**  A well-defined database schema will be designed to ensure data integrity and efficiency.  Data modeling will adhere to best practices for healthcare data management.

* **Third-Party Integrations:**  Integration with various EHR systems, LIS, RIS, and pharmacy systems will be achieved through their respective APIs.


**6. Acceptance Criteria:**

* **AI-Powered Diagnostic Support:**  Accuracy rate of at least 90% validated against a gold standard dataset.  Compliance with all relevant regulatory standards.
* **Predictive Analytics:**  Demonstrated ability to identify high-risk patients with a precision and recall rate of at least 80%.  Algorithm transparency and bias mitigation measures documented.
* **Patient Portal:**  Successful completion of usability testing with a satisfaction score of at least 4 out of 5.  Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* **Automated Workflow Management:**  Error rate of less than 1%.  Successful completion of integration testing with other systems.
* **Telemedicine:**  Compliance with HIPAA and all relevant state regulations.  Successful completion of security and performance testing.

**Success Metrics & KPIs:**  User adoption rate, physician satisfaction, patient satisfaction, reduction in medical errors, improved patient outcomes, reduction in administrative overhead.

**User Acceptance Criteria:**  Users (physicians, nurses, administrative staff, and patients) will be involved in user acceptance testing (UAT) to validate the functionality and usability of the system.


**7. Release Criteria:**

* **MVP Definition:**  The MVP will include the core features: patient portal, appointment scheduling, secure messaging, and basic reporting.  AI-powered diagnostics and predictive analytics will be added in subsequent releases.
* **Launch Readiness Checklist:**  Comprehensive checklist covering all aspects of deployment, including security, performance, and data migration.
* **Post-Launch Monitoring Requirements:**  Continuous monitoring of system performance, security, and user feedback.  Regular bug fixes and updates will be implemented.

**8. Assumptions and Dependencies:**

* **Technical Assumptions:**  Availability of reliable APIs from third-party systems.  Sufficient computing resources in the cloud infrastructure.
* **Business Assumptions:**  Market demand for a unified healthcare platform.  Secure funding for development and maintenance.
* **External Dependencies:**  Third-party API providers, cloud infrastructure providers, regulatory compliance bodies.
