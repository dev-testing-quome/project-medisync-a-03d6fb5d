# project-##-medisync:-a

## Overview

MediSync is a unified healthcare platform designed to streamline workflows and improve patient care by consolidating disparate data sources into a single, secure, and accessible interface.  It targets physicians, nurses, administrative staff, and patients, addressing pain points such as fragmented data, inefficient scheduling, and poor communication.  MediSync leverages AI-powered diagnostic support and predictive analytics to enhance efficiency and proactive care.

## Features

**Core Features:**

* **AI-Powered Diagnostic Support:**  Provides preliminary diagnostic suggestions based on integrated EHR and imaging data analysis.
* **Predictive Analytics for Patient Risk Management:** Identifies high-risk patients for proactive interventions.
* **Secure Patient Portal:** Offers patients secure access to medical records, appointment scheduling, provider communication, and prescription management.
* **Automated Workflow Management:** Automates tasks like appointment reminders and lab result notifications.
* **Integrated Telemedicine:** Enables secure video consultations.

**Technical Highlights:**

* Microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability.
* Cloud-based infrastructure (AWS/Azure compatible).
* Secure API integrations with existing EHR systems.
* Intuitive and user-friendly UI across devices.


## Technology Stack

* **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11+) with SQLAlchemy ORM
* **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
* **Database**: SQLite (Production: PostgreSQL or other scalable database recommended)
* **Containerization**: Docker
* **Cloud Platform:** AWS/Azure (adaptable)


## Prerequisites

* Python 3.11 or higher
* Node.js 18 or higher
* npm
* Docker (optional, but recommended for development and deployment)
* A code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.)


## Installation

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-##-medisync:-a
   ```

2. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv .venv  # Creating a virtual environment in the current directory.
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Application:**

   * **Backend:** (from `backend` directory)
     ```bash
     uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
     ```

   * **Frontend:** (from `frontend` directory)
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```


### Docker Setup

1.  Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2.  Build and run the application using Docker Compose:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```


## API Documentation

Once the application is running, access the interactive API documentation at:

* **Swagger UI:** http://localhost:8000/docs
* **ReDoc:** http://localhost:8000/redoc


## Usage

**Key Endpoints (Examples -  replace with actual endpoints):**

* `/patients`:  GET to retrieve a list of patients, POST to create a new patient.
* `/appointments`: GET to retrieve appointments, POST to create an appointment.
* `/prescriptions`: GET to retrieve prescriptions, POST to create a prescription.
* `/diagnostic-suggestions/{patient_id}`: GET to retrieve AI-generated diagnostic suggestions.


**Sample Request (GET /patients):**

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/patients
```

**Sample Response (GET /patients):**

```json
[
  {"id": 1, "name": "John Doe", ...},
  {"id": 2, "name": "Jane Smith", ...}
]
```

**Common Workflows:**  Detailed workflows will be documented within the application code and potentially in separate documentation files.
