# Deployment Guide - project-##-medisync:-a

## Prerequisites

**Required Software and Tools:**

* Docker:  `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install docker docker-compose` (Linux example; adjust for your OS)
* Git:  `sudo apt-get install git` (Linux example; adjust for your OS)
* AWS CLI (if deploying to AWS): `pip install awscli`
* Azure CLI (if deploying to Azure):  `npm install -g azure-cli`
* Kubernetes CLI (kubectl) (if using Kubernetes): Download from [kubernetes.io](kubernetes.io)
* A text editor or IDE.

**System Requirements:**

*  A server with sufficient CPU, RAM, and storage to handle the expected workload.  Specific requirements will depend on the scale of deployment.  A minimum of 4 CPU cores, 8GB RAM, and 50GB storage is recommended for a small-scale deployment.
*  Network connectivity with sufficient bandwidth.

**Account Setup:**

* **Cloud Provider:** Create accounts with your chosen cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP).  Ensure you have appropriate permissions to create resources (VMs, databases, storage).
* **Database:** Create a database instance (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) on your chosen cloud provider or on-premises.  Note the connection string.
* **External Services:** Set up accounts with any external services MediSync integrates with (e.g., EHR APIs, payment gateways).


## Environment Setup

**Environment Variables Configuration:**

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables (replace placeholders with your actual values):

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/database
API_KEY_EXTERNAL_SERVICE=your_api_key
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_access_key
# ... other environment variables ...
```

**Database Setup:**

1.  Connect to your database instance using a database client (e.g., pgAdmin, MySQL Workbench).
2.  Create the database specified in `DATABASE_URL`.
3.  Run database migrations (see Database Setup section below).


**External Service Configuration:**

Configure API keys and credentials for any external services MediSync interacts with.  These credentials should be stored securely (e.g., using AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault).


## Docker Deployment

**Building the Docker Image:**

Navigate to the project root and run:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

**Running with docker-compose:**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command builds and starts all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`.  Ensure your `docker-compose.yml` file is configured correctly to include all necessary services (API, database, etc.).  An example:

```yaml
version: "3.9"
services:
  api:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}
      # ... other environment variables
  database:
    image: postgres:14
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
      - POSTGRES_DB=database
```

**Environment Configuration:**

Docker Compose automatically reads environment variables from the `.env` file.

**Health Checks and Monitoring:**

Include health checks within your application's Dockerfile and use Docker Compose's healthcheck feature to monitor service health.  Example in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
  api:
    # ...
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
```


## Production Deployment

**Cloud Deployment Options:**

* **AWS:** Use AWS Elastic Beanstalk, ECS, or EKS for deploying the Dockerized application.
* **Azure:** Use Azure App Service, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), or Azure Container Instances (ACI).
* **GCP:** Use Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Google App Engine, or Cloud Run.

**Container Orchestration:**

* **Kubernetes:** Deploy your application as Kubernetes pods, managing scaling and deployment across multiple nodes.
* **Docker Swarm:**  A simpler container orchestration solution suitable for smaller deployments.

**Load Balancing and Scaling:**

Use the load balancing services provided by your cloud provider to distribute traffic across multiple instances of your application.  Implement autoscaling to automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand.

**SSL/TLS Configuration:**

Configure SSL/TLS certificates using a service like Let's Encrypt or your cloud provider's certificate manager.


## Database Setup

**Database Migration Commands:**

Use a migration tool (e.g., Alembic for SQLAlchemy) to manage database schema changes.  Run migration scripts during deployment:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

**Initial Data Setup:**

Populate the database with initial data using seed scripts.

**Backup and Recovery Procedures:**

Implement regular database backups (e.g., using cloud provider's backup services or pg_dump) and define a recovery procedure to restore the database from backups in case of failure.


## Monitoring & Logging

**Application Monitoring Setup:**

Use a monitoring tool like Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog to monitor application metrics (e.g., CPU usage, memory usage, request latency).

**Log Aggregation:**

Use a centralized logging system like Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK stack) or a cloud-based logging service to collect and analyze logs from all application components.

**Performance Monitoring:**

Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response times, error rates, and throughput.

**Error Tracking:**

Use an error tracking service like Sentry or Rollbar to capture and analyze application errors.


## Troubleshooting

**Common Deployment Issues:**

* Network connectivity problems.
* Database connection errors.
* Incorrect environment variable settings.
* Container image build failures.

**Debug Commands:**

* `docker logs <container_name>` to view container logs.
* `docker exec -it <container_name> bash` to access a running container's shell.

**Log Locations:**

Log locations vary depending on the application and logging configuration.  Consult your application's logging documentation.

**Recovery Procedures:**

Define procedures for recovering from failures, including restoring from backups, restarting containers, and rolling back deployments.


## Security Considerations

**Environment Variable Security:**

Do not hardcode sensitive information in code. Use environment variables and secure secrets management services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager).

**Network Security:**

Use firewalls and security groups to restrict access to your application and databases.

**Authentication Setup:**

Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication.

**Regular Security Updates:**

Keep all software components (application, database, operating system) up to date with the latest security patches.  Regular security audits and penetration testing are also recommended.


This guide provides a framework.  Specific commands and configurations will need to be adapted to your project's specific technology stack and deployment environment.  Remember to thoroughly test your deployment process in a staging environment before deploying to production.
